Replica Set 
Write a common use-case, where you will use a daemon set instead of replica set.

A DaemonSet ensures that all (or some) Nodes run a copy of a Pod.
when we want to run a cluster storage daemon on every node
if we want to run a logs collection daemon pod on every node
if we want to run a node monitoring daemon on every node
